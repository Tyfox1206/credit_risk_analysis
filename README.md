# credit_risk_analysis

## Overview

this analysis is to understand how to use machine learning to make predictions usind different algorithms. This challenge was based on supercised learning. and used 5 difffernt algorithms to process the data.

## Results

### Naive Random Oversampling
![oversampling](https://github.com/Tyfox1206/credit_risk_analysis/blob/main/images/oversampling.PNG)

* Accuracy - 66%
* Precision - low for high risk - high for low risk
* Recall - high risk 0.66 - low risk 0.67
